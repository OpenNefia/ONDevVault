The current system is a tire fire and a blatant ripoff of RimWorld's `ExposeData`-based solution, but given how I'm not some kind of genius with reflection and the like, I will probably put off replacing the current system until OpenNefia is at least mildly playable first.

It might be worth looking at how [RobustToolbox deals with serialization](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox/tree/master/Robust.Shared/Serialization).

(My inferiority complex is steadily kicking into overdrive...)
